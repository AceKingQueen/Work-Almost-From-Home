# Work-Almost-From-Home

Using multiple API calls, this application takes user input, finds job postings in an area, and pins the open jobs on a map.

Due to our working arrangement with ZipRecruiter, this version of the app no longer works (our API key was only good for a limited window of time) but screenshots of the working app are provided below.

We made this website in 10 days. We had a working version after 7 days and then had a major Git mishap, where we lost our working version. 

It was our first project built using Git's version control and our group did not have a uniform merging to the master branch strategy. Many lessons were learned.
